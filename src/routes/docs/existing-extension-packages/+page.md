| `@svelte-router/kit` | [Repository](https://github.com/WJSoftware/svelte-router-kit) [Documentation](/docs/sveltekit-support) | **AVAILABLE NOW!** The official extension package for Sveltekit projects. It enables hash routing while leaving path routing to **Sveltekit**’s routing system. It can do single and multi-hash routing. |
| `@svelte-router/mem` | [Upvote issue if interested](https://github.com/WJSoftware/svelte-router/issues/7)                     | **COMING …?** The official extension package that only routes using an in-memory location URL. The environment’s URL never changes.                                                                      |
